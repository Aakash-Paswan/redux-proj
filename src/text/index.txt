What is Redux?
    Redux is predictable state container for Javascript apps.
    Manage the state of the application in a predictable way, redux can help for that.
    
    * It is for Javascript apps

                Redux is not to React
                Can be used with React, Angular, Vue, or even Vanilla Javascript
                Redux is a library for Javascript applications.


    * It is a state container

                Redux store the state of the applications.
                state of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of the app
                Redux will store and manage the application state


    * It is predictable (always behaving or occurring in the way expected)

                Redux is a state container 
                The state of the app can change
                Ex- todo list app - item (pending) => item (completed)
                In redux, all state transitions are explicit and it is possible to keep track of them
                The changes to my application's state become predictable.
